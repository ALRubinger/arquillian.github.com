The much anticipated announcement about which students were selected to participate in the Google Summer of Code program "was announced today":http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2012/04/students-announced-for-google-summer-of.html. There are 1,212 students participating in total. We'd like to congratulate all the students accepted and wish you all best of luck this summer!

The JBoss Community is proud to be participating as an independent mentor organization for the first year. We were selected thanks to a strong showing of volunteer mentors and an "overwhelming number of compelling and creative ideas":https://community.jboss.org/wiki/GSoC12Ideas. A majority of those ideas came from the Arquillian community. I'd like to extend a big *thank you* to everyone who came forward with ideas. Acceptances aside, these ideas are already helping shape the future of the project.

h3. Accepted proposals

Google granted the JBoss Community 8 student slots. From those 8 slots, Arquillian was allotted 2 slots--far less than the number of excellent proposals submitted. After much agonizing over the decision for the last week, the Arquillian mentors decided to award the slots to the following two student proposals:

table(table table-bordered table-striped).
|_{width: 20%}. Title|Extend Arquillian to support Spring testing (beans and MVC controllers)|
|_. Student|"Jakub Narloch":profile://jmnarloch|
|_. Mentor|"Marius Bogoevici":profile://marius.bogoevici|

table(table table-bordered table-striped).
|_{width: 20%}. Title|Automated Visual Verification|
|_. Student|Jakub Dunia|
|_. Mentor|"Lukas Fryc":profile://lfryc|

Congratulations to Jakub x 2!

Jakub Narloch is already well on his way to bringing Spring testing support to Arquillian by implementing a prototype. You can read about the status of his prototype in the "GSoC - Arquillian Spring integration":https://community.jboss.org/thread/197356 forum thread.

There's an additional testing-related proposal, sponsored by the Errai team, that was also accepted:

table(table table-bordered table-striped).
|_{width: 20%}. Title|A Jenkins plugin to visualize Jacoco code coverage reports|
|_. Student|Ognjen Bubalo|
|_. Mentor|"Jonathan Fuerth":profile://jfuerth|

Congratulations to Ognjen!

Jakub, Jakub and Ognjen, please contact your mentors immediately. Make a plan to communicate with your mentor regularly, at minimum, once each week. Since we're big believers in openness, the best way to keep in touch is through a public channel such as the "Arquillian development forum":#{site.dev_forum} or the #jbosstesting channel on Freenode IRC.

We also plan to publish your status reports here on arquillian.org to allow the community to follow your progress and provide feedback. For those watching, stay tuned!

h3. Alternate proposals

Although we could only accept two proposals, there were _many_ well-written proposals that truly deserved a slot (if only we had more to give). I'd like to thank the students for the time spend preparing and submitting them by highlighting them here:

Despite the fact that these proposals were not accepted into GSoC, we _really_ want to see them pursued. We're exploring a diverse approach to enable students to continue them, ranging from Red Hat summer internships to community-supported projects. Our plan is to closely track the GSoC schedule to keep the projects on track and to give you, the students, the experience the comes with completing a summer project (and likely increase your chance of being awarded a slot next year).

Stay tuned for details. Also, keep an eye on this blog for periodic progress reports about the GSoC student projects and any additional non-GSoC summer projects.
