Mark the date, 2. October 2011: Arquillian wins a "Duke's Choice Award":http://www.java.com/en/dukeschoice for Innovative Integration Testing at "JavaOne 2011":http://www.oracle.com/javaone.

Is there a better way to start of a though week then to get a solid acknowledgement for the hardwork that you have already put in? I can't think of any..  

This one goes out to all of us; coders, bloggers and evangelists in the Arquillian sphear. Excellent work! 


?? As a community we will continue on our mission to explore strange new gaps, seek out new frameworks and integration points, and boldly go where no test software has gone before.
