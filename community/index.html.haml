    As an open-source project, the Arquillian community has many entry points. We welcome your participation however it suits your level of interest.
    
    The "Arquillian space":#{site.project_space} in the JBoss Community and the #jbosstesting channel on the Freenode IRC network are the main channels of communication between all community members.

    Keep in mind that contributing code is not the only way to get involved. You can provide feedback on documentation and tutorials, test the releases, share your visions or just participate in the forum discussions. The various entry points are summarized below. See you there!

    There are two discussion forums under the "Arquillian space":#{site.project_space} in the JBoss Community site.
  
    - "User discussions":#{site.user_forum} := The top-level space hosts discussions for developers using Arquillian in their project.
    - "Development discussions":#{site.dev_forum} := The development sub-space is reserved for discussions about contributing to Arquillian.

    These spaces also host community-edited information about Arquillian, under the Articles tab. The information that goes here is anything you want to share about the project that doesn't fit somewhere else, or you want to share quickly. It may be tips, guides or even full articles.

    h2. Chat (IRC) !/images/chat.png!

    !(screenshot)/images/screenshot-arquillian-irc.png!
  
    We invite you to join us in the #jbosstesting channel on irc.freenode.net to chat about Arquillian, ShrinkWrap and other topics related to testing. The #jbosstesting channel has a broad scope as it brings together all folks in the JBoss Community who are passionate about testing.
    
    This channel is logged to "transcripts.jboss.org":#{site.irc_transcripts} by JBossBot. The JBossBot is also present to expand issue numbers from the issue tracker.

    If you don't have an IRC client installed or available, you can use the "web-based client":webchat on this site to join the #jbosstesting channel.

    h2. Issue Tracker !/images/jira.png(JIRA)!

    !(screenshot)/images/screenshot-arquillian-jira.png!
  
    The project tracks bugs, feature-requests, and other issues through the JIRA issue-tracking system at JBoss.org.

    "Arquillian issue tracker":#{site.issue_tracker} | "Outstanding issues":https://issues.jboss.org/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&mode=hide&jqlQuery=project+%3D+ARQ+AND+resolution+%3D+Unresolved+ORDER+BY+updated+DESC
  
    Note: To file issues or requests with JIRA, you must have a JBoss Community account (don't worry, signing up is easy).

    h2. Source Repository !/images/git_42.png(Git)!

    !(screenshot)/images/screenshot-arquillian-github.png!

    All the Arquillian source code is managed using the distributed version system "git":http://git-scm.com and hosted in sub-modules of the "arquillian organization":http://github.com/#{site.github_organization} at github.com.

    Both git and github are awesome for collaboration! To make improvements or bug fixes to the Arquillian project, simply fork the project, commit your changes and send a pull request.
