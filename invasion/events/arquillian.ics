DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>It’s great to have a solid base of unit and integr
 ation tests\; they give us confidence about the overall system integrity
 . But at the end of the day\, it all amounts to whether our end users ar
 e happy using our application. So how can we keep the fail whale at bay 
 and communicate with the stakeholders that the requirements are being me
 t?</p>\n<p>Not too long ago\, running tests that were going beyond isola
 tion was a challenging task. This required a well thought out process as
  part of the automated build. Nowadays we are equipped with a “Swiss A
 rmy knife” for almost all aspects of testing. Along this journey\, in 
 the world of testing\, we will take a closer look at some of these tools
 .</p>\n<p>We will learn that the Arquillian ecosystem is way more than j
 ust integration testing\; it’s a comprehensive testing platform. We wi
 ll dive into the concept of Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD) an
 d demonstrate how to build higher-level\, end-to-end functional tests\; 
 we will be emulating user interactions using the Arquillian Drone extens
 ion together with the open source browser automation tool Selenium. Reus
 able components like Page Objects will make our tests cleaner and easier
  to maintain. Eventually we will sugar coat them with a Groovy DSL for B
 ehaviour Driven Development to achieve testing nirvana.<br />\nIf you ca
 re about quality of your software you definitely shouldn’t miss this t
 alk!</p>\n

DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>There’s no better way to communicate about the sof
 tware you’re developing—no way that’s more real\, meaningful and m
 easurable—than by using tests\, real tests. Tests tell a story about h
 ow the software is expected to behave and the purpose it serves. They al
 so demonstrate the software does what it is expected to do. If either ha
 lf of the equation is broken\, you have something tangible to fix and a 
 basis for a conversation about it.</p>\n<p>In this session\, we’ll exp
 lore agile development tools that help create real tests that show real 
 results and collect real feedback. We’ll explore the concepts of Behav
 ior-Driven Development (BDD) and Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATD
 D) through the use of tools from the Arquillian Universe such as Arquill
 ian Drone\, Selenium\, Thucydides and Spock to demonstrate how to use re
 al tests to drive development.</p>\n<p>Testing features and behaviors ha
 s never been so clear and so real! What you’ll take away is a medium t
 hrough which to communicate with stakeholders about the software in whic
 h you’re both investing.</p>\n
