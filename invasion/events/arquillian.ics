SUMMARY:Continuous Enterprise Development in Java
DESCRIPTION:\n					<p>Are you confident enough to push your application to 
 production right now? Will it deploy? Integrate all the components? Keep th
 e fail whale at bay? Confidence comes from tests. Real tests.</p>\n<p>Disco
 ver how to use Arquillian to develop tests that execute inside a container\
 , use BDD and ATDD for integration and acceptance tests that your stakehold
 ers can grok and gain the confidence you need to continue developing\, know
 ing your application will remain standing when faced with the real world.</

SUMMARY:Acceptance Test Driven Development with Arquillian
DESCRIPTION:\n				\n					<p>It’s great to have a solid base of unit and i
 ntegration tests\; this gives us confidence about overall system integrity.
  But at the end of the day it all amounts to whether our end users are happ
 y using our application. So how can we keep the fail whale at bay and commu
 nicate with the stakeholders that the requirements are being met?</p>\n\n<p
 >During this talk we will see that the Arquillian ecosystem is way more tha
 n just integration testing. We will dive into the concept of Acceptance Tes
 t Driven Development (ATDD) and demonstrate how to build higher-level\, end
 -to-end functional tests\; we willl be emulating user interactions using th
 e Arquillian Drone extension together with the open source browser automati
 on tool WebDriver. Reusable web testing components called Page Objects will
  make our tests cleaner and easier to maintain. Eventually we will sugar co
 at them with a Groovy DSL for Behaviour Driven Development to achieve testi
 ng nirvana.</p>\n\n<p>If you care about quality of your software you defini
 tely shouldn&#39\;t miss this talk! Expect to see lots of live demos!</p>\n
