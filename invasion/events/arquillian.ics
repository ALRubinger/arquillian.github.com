DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>This highly technical session examines solutions for
  easing the testing of some of the more complex use cases within Java EE
 . Each example is backed by a runnable test (publicly available to parti
 cipants)\, and the presentation covers automated continuous development 
 of:</p>\n<ul class="bullets">\n  <li>The Web user interface (via Seleniu
 m)</li>\n  <li>Persistent data and JPA</li>\n  <li>Transactional boundar
 ies</li>\n  <li>Cloud-based deployments</li>\n  <li>RESTful endpoints</l
 i>\n  <li>More</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Expect a lot of proof through open source
  demos. You&#39\;ll see the presenters exercise the features of any comp
 liant Java EE 6 runtime\, using the Arquillian platform.</p>\n

DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>In today&#39\;s system development era it is conside
 red standard that a developer writes unit tests for new code. But when i
 t comes to integration testing it is often done manually in a more or le
 ss arbitrary way. However\, there is no valid reason to skip writing aut
 omated integration tests anymore. I&#39\;m going to talk about why you s
 hould do automated integration testing and how you can do it in Java usi
 ng Arquillian. I&#39\;m also going to share my experiences with MongoDB 
 from an enterprise environment\, and how we&#39\;ve built automated inte
 gration tests around MongoDB.</p>\n
