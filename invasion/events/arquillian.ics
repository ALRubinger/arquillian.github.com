SUMMARY:Arquillian : An introduction
DESCRIPTION:\n				\n					<p>This presentation unveils the missing link in e
 nterprise Java development: simple\, portable integration tests. It introdu
 ces a solution in the first half of the session and demonstrates it in the 
 second.</p>\n\n<p>Unit tests and mocks get you only so far. Eventually you 
 need to verify that your components operate and interact correctly in their
  intended environment—you need integration tests. Yet writing integration
  tests has meant taking on the barrier of bootstrapping the necessary infra
 structure.</p>\n\n<p>Arquillian\, a container-oriented testing framework bu
 ilt on TestNG and JUnit\, tears down this barrier. It enables you to write 
 portable tests that invoke real components using real enterprise services i
 n a real runtime. In other words\, you can write real tests.</p>\n\n<p>Usin
 g Arquillian\, you can write tests with confidence\, knowing fully well tha
 t your functionality is tested\, as if it were operating in a production en
 vironment. Arquillian also ships with powerful extensions for popular libra
 ries that will enable you to bring your existing tests into the container.<

SUMMARY:Arquillian - a fresh look at enterprise testing.
DESCRIPTION:\n				\n					<p>We all know that unit tests are great\, but rel
 ying only on them is most of the times just an illusion of safety. Eventual
 ly we need to verify how our components are interacting or whether running 
 in the target environment does not end up with some unexpected behaviour. L
 ast but not least it all amounts to whether your application is providing t
 he end user what he or she is really expecting.</p>\n\n<p>Not so long ago r
 unning in-container integration tests was a challenging task and required a
  well thought process as a part of the automated build. Nowadays we are equ
 ipped with a &quot\;Swiss Army knife&quot\; for almost any aspect of testin
 g. Along this journey in the world of testing we will take a closer look at
  Arquillian\, testing framework from JBoss\, which hides complexity of test
 ing Java EE applications by managing your runtime\, abstracting out deploym
 ent process and allowing you to focus on real test logic.</p>\n\n<p>I will 
 explain what Arquillian is\, how it can make our lives easier and bring bac
 k the fun in writing tests! We will also see that Arquillian ecosystem is w
 ay more than just integration testing. After looking at available extension
 s we will dive straight into UI testing so you can learn how to write funct
 ional tests in BDD manner using Groovy and Arquillian together with Seleniu
 m/WebDriver.</p>\n				\n

SUMMARY:Designing Top-Class Test Suites for Web Applications
DESCRIPTION:\n				\n					<p>The evolution which came with the Arquillian\, 
 award-winning integration test framework\, and Selenium\, outstanding tool 
 for UI automation\, allows to write high-quality tests. But these technolog
 ies can’t save the world by themselves\, since they are leaving too many 
 questions open:</p>\n\n<p>* Does Selenium cover everything? It covers page 
 transitions\, a simple JavaScript interaction and a portion of DOM. Is it r
 eally enough?<br />* Mocking requests for testing server-side code is pain.
  Is it necessary?<br />* Are you able to detect that your component’s vis
 ual representation changes?<br />* Does investigating these changes involve
  a disproportionate amount of effort?<br />* Isn’t manual test developmen
 t too expensive?</p>\n\n<p>What if you could fill all the above gaps?</p>\n
