DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>This highly technical session examines solutions for
  easing the testing of some of the more complex use cases within Java EE
 . Each example is backed by a runnable test (publicly available to parti
 cipants)\, and the presentation covers automated continuous development 
 of:</p>\n<ul class="bullets">\n  <li>The Web user interface (via Seleniu
 m)</li>\n  <li>Persistent data and JPA</li>\n  <li>Transactional boundar
 ies</li>\n  <li>Cloud-based deployments</li>\n  <li>RESTful endpoints</l
 i>\n  <li>More</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It showcases various techniques outlined 
 in the book Continuous Enterprise Development in Java\, forthcoming from
  O’Reilly Media\, and is delivered by the authors. Expect a lot of pro
 of through open source demos. You&#39\;ll see the presenters exercise th
 e features of any compliant Java EE 6 runtime\, using the Arquillian pla
 tform.</p>\n

DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>A common complaint you hear a lot about Java develop
 ment is that it is quite a burden to get started. For a newbie\, it take
 s a lot of knowledge and effort to even put the simplest JSF application
  to work. A second element that bothers a lot of people is that it is ve
 ry difficult to verify that your enterprise components actually do what 
 they are supposed to do. Even for seasoned enterprise developers integra
 tion testing can be a huge challenge<br />\nLuckily two recent additions
  to the JBoss toolset come to the rescue. Arquillian is a container-orie
 nted testing framework built on TestNG and JUnit. It takes down the barr
 ier of bootstrapping the necessary infrastructure when trying to perform
  integration tests. It lets you test your components in their real targe
 t runtime environment using real enterprise services. Secondly\, JBoss F
 orge is an incremental enhancement tool that lets you take an existing J
 ava project and safely add in new functionality. Whether you want to set
  up JSF\, use persistence or enable integration testing with Arquillian\
 , it all becomes a real breeze.<br />\nAttend this session to learn how 
 to take advantage of both these tools. You will see how they can be used
  to rapidly create\, test and deploy enterprise Java applications. In ad
 dition\, I will show how you can extend the functionality of JBoss Forge
  by creating plugins.</p>\n

DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>The myth of Java EE as a cumbersome platform is one 
 we easily dispel in this session. Here we&#39\;ll create a working appli
 cation from a blank repository and push it to a live cloud deployment\, 
 in real time. During which time we&#39\;ll:</p>\n<ul class="bullets">\n 
  <li>Cover tooling to bootstrap project creation (Forge)\, freeing you f
 rom mucking around with Maven POM boilerplate</li>\n  <li>Generate a dom
 ain model and reverse-engineer JPA entities from it</li>\n  <li>Automati
 cally creates the scaffolding for tests that run in a real Java EE conta
 iner (Arquillian)\, launched from the IDE</li>\n  <li>Push it all to pro
 duction on a public site (OpenShift)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Using a variety of 
 projects from the JBoss Community adhering to and building upon open sta
 ndards\, this presentation can create real enterprise apps in the time i
 t takes other sessions to click through some slides. Let’s get buildin
 g!</p>\n
