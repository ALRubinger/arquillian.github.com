DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>Arquillian is an innovative and highly extensible te
 sting platform for the JVM that enables developers to easily create auto
 mated integration\, functional and acceptance tests for Java middleware\
 , from Java EE and beyond.</p>\n<p>In this presentation\, we&#39\;ll foc
 us on the &quot\;highly extensible&quot\; part\, one of Arquillian&#39\;
 s proven strengths. Arquillian was designed with the ability to change i
 ts default behavior via its powerful extension model. These extensions a
 re portals through which Arquillian can travel to take on challenges in 
 new domains or those yet to be realized.</p>\n<p>This presentation takes
  you on a tour through the universe of Arquillian extensions by demonstr
 ating how specific extensions solve common problematic testing scenarios
  faced by enterprise developers. You will get a overview of what extensi
 ons and extension points are available today and what ideas are starting
  to take shape in the community.</p>\n
