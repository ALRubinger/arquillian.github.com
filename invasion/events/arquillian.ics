SUMMARY:How to Test Enterprise Java Applications
DESCRIPTION:\n					<p>Ten years ago to present\, Enterprise Java Applicatio
 ns have suffered many changes. We have moved from Enterprise Applications b
 uilt with JSP+Servlet and EJB\, to much more complex applications. Nowadays
  with the advent of HTML5 or JavaScript libraries like JQuery\, client side
  development has changed significantly. With the emergence of web framework
 s like Spring MVC or JSF\, server side code has quite changed compared to t
 he one used when each web-form was mapped to a Servlet. And also persistenc
 e layer has changed with Java Persistence standard or with new database app
 roaches like Data-Grid\, Key-Values stores or Document stores.</p>\n<p>More
 over\, architectural changes have occurred too\, REST-web applications have
  grown in popularity or AJAX is used to create asynchronous web application
 s. Due to development of Enterprise Java Applications have changed during t
 hese years\, so testing frameworks have changed accordantly. The main topic
  of this speech will be how to test Enterprise Java Applications using thes
 e new frameworks.</p>\n<p>In the first part of this presentation we are goi
 ng to explore how to test JavaScript written on client side\, how to write 
 unit tests of server side code\, and how to validate persistence layer. Nex
 t part of presentation will be focused on how to write integration tests on
  server side and acceptance tests on full Enterprise Java Applications (joi
 ning client and server side) and an introduction about testing REST-web app
 lications. Finally we will show how to integrate all kind of test on your c
 ontinuous integration system and run acceptance tests on test environment.<
 /p>\n<p>Session will combine theory with interactive practice using only op
 en-source projects.</p>\n

SUMMARY:Continuous Enterprise Development in Java
DESCRIPTION:\n					<p>Are you confident enough to push your application to 
 production right now? Will it deploy? Integrate all the components? Keep th
 e fail whale at bay? Confidence comes from tests. Real tests.</p>\n<p>Disco
 ver how to use Arquillian to develop tests that execute inside a container\
 , use BDD and ATDD for integration and acceptance tests that your stakehold
 ers can grok and gain the confidence you need to continue developing\, know
 ing your application will remain standing when faced with the real world.</

SUMMARY:Acceptance Test Driven Development with Arquillian
DESCRIPTION:\n				\n					<p>It’s great to have a solid base of unit and i
 ntegration tests\; this gives us confidence about overall system integrity.
  But at the end of the day it all amounts to whether our end users are happ
 y using our application. So how can we keep the fail whale at bay and commu
 nicate with the stakeholders that the requirements are being met?</p>\n\n<p
 >During this talk we will see that the Arquillian ecosystem is way more tha
 n just integration testing. We will dive into the concept of Acceptance Tes
 t Driven Development (ATDD) and demonstrate how to build higher-level\, end
 -to-end functional tests\; we willl be emulating user interactions using th
 e Arquillian Drone extension together with the open source browser automati
 on tool WebDriver. Reusable web testing components called Page Objects will
  make our tests cleaner and easier to maintain. Eventually we will sugar co
 at them with a Groovy DSL for Behaviour Driven Development to achieve testi
 ng nirvana.</p>\n\n<p>If you care about quality of your software you defini
 tely shouldn&#39\;t miss this talk! Expect to see lots of live demos!</p>\n
