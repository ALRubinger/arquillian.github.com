DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>Davide D&#39\;Alto - one of the contributors to Arqu
 illian - will present an Arquillian Overview.<br />\nThrough some usage 
 scenarios he will give an overview over the main features of Arquillian 
 and will show how it integrates to more familiar testing frameworks such
  as JUnit allowing the tests to be launched from the IDE or from buildin
 g tools like Maven.</p>\n

DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>Arquillian is a revolutionary testing platform for J
 ava and the JVM that enables developers to easily create and execute int
 egration and functional tests for Java middleware\, from Java EE and bey
 ond. One of Arquillian’s strong points is its extensibility. Arquillia
 n was built with the ability to change its default behavior via its powe
 rful extension model as well as to grow past its original programming to
  take on the challenges of tomorrow. This presentation guides you throug
 h the Arquillian extensions by demonstrating how specific extensions sol
 ve common problematic testing scenarios faced by enterprise developers. 
 You will get a overview of what is available and possible today as well 
 as what is brewing in the community.</p>\n

DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>Your chance to make a positive impact in an Open Sou
 rce project of your choice. Hackergarten meetings are all about having f
 un\, meeting new friends\, learning new skills and making the world a be
 tter place\, one code patch at a time.</p>\n<p>Hackergarten @ Devoxx is 
 scheduled for the second day of the Devoxx University. It will take plac
 e in the two extra rooms (Area 1 &amp\; 2\, each approx. 50m2) in the ex
 hibition floor. The Hackergarten session is a FREE (that&#39\;s right\, 
 GRATIS) event\, open to anyone  in the area that&#39\;s willing to get t
 heir hands dirty with some code.</p>\n<p>Hackergarten contributions have
  been sent to the following projects in the past: Groovy\, Grails\, Grif
 fon\, Gradle\, Spock\, Arquillian\, JBoss Forge\, Intellij IDEA\, ScalaF
 X and more. Come join us for a full day of fun and open source goodness.
  Let your voice be heard! Bring your laptop and enjoy the opportunity to
  rub shoulders with project team members.</p>\n<p>Organizer: Andres Almi

DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>The Persistence Layer is one of the most crucial par
 ts of enterprise applications\, and we use many different frameworks and
  patterns to keep it clean. We write sophisticated queries and use optim
 ization techniques to give our end users the greatest possible experienc
 e.</p>\n<p>So why is Persistence very often skipped in testing efforts? 
 Is it really that complex and painful to setup? The Arquillian Persisten
 ce Extension removes that burden and boilerplate to make you a happy and
  productive programmer again! Join this session and see for yourself tha
 t writing tests for your database logic is as easy as writing normal uni
 t tests! Don&#39\;t expect too many slides\, be prepared for live demo!<
