DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>After years when there were EJBs and there was Test 
 Driven Development\, the two worlds finally met each other. Taking the l
 atest EJB standard\,it&#39\;s embeddable container standard\, Arquillian
  and classic testing techniques (starting from TDD\, through GOOS and fe
 w others) we can build a complete enterprise solution guided by tests. I
 n this live coding session I&#39\;ll go through multiple EJB 3.1 feature
 s\, building and deploying a complete enterprise application\, fully cov
 ered with tests. From tiniest little bits of &#39\;business logic&#39\; 
 through data model\, finishing with external API (web\, REST and SOAP)\,
  each and every step covered with just enough tests to give confidence a
 pplication is working as desired. Discussing each feature from both spec
 ification and testability perspective\, will provide a comprehensive wal
 kthrough an EJB architecture\, features provided by specification as wel
 l as through testing the app itself as well as the application server bo
 undary. So don&#39\;t blame EJBs for your server not being testable.</p>

DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>There’s no better way to communicate about the sof
 tware you’re developing—no way that’s more real\, meaningful and m
 easurable—than by using tests\, real tests. Tests tell a story about h
 ow the software is expected to behave and the purpose it serves. They al
 so demonstrate the software does what it is expected to do. If either ha
 lf of the equation is broken\, you have something tangible to fix and a 
 basis for a conversation about it.</p>\n<p>In this session\, we’ll exp
 lore agile development tools that help create real tests that show real 
 results and collect real feedback. We’ll explore the concepts of Behav
 ior-Driven Development (BDD) and Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATD
 D) through the use of tools from the Arquillian Universe such as Arquill
 ian Drone\, Selenium\, Thucydides and Spock to demonstrate how to use re
 al tests to drive development.</p>\n<p>Testing features and behaviors ha
 s never been so clear and so real! What you’ll take away is a medium t
 hrough which to communicate with stakeholders about the software in whic
 h you’re both investing.</p>\n
