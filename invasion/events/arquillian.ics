DESCRIPTION:\n					<p>Unit tests are programmer&#39\;s best friend\, but 
 relying on them exclusively gives an illusion of overall system integrit
 y. At some level\, we need to verify how our components integrate and en
 sure unexpected behavior does not creep in when we shift the application
  into the target runtime. It all amounts to whether your application is 
 providing the end user what he or she is really needs (tire swing) inste
 ad of what anyone thinks they need. How can we save our users from frust
 ration\, keep the fail whale at bay and communicate with stakeholders th
 at the requirements are being met?</p>\n<p>We&#39\;ll show you how the A
 rquillian testing platform can give you these guarantees by driving agil
 e development. We&#39\;ll explore the concepts of BDD and ATDD together 
 using a powerful trio of testing frameworks: Arquillian\, WebDriver and 
 Thucydides. Rather than just test cases\, you&#39\;ll build higher-level
 \, end-to-end functional behavior using reusable web test components and
  following a clear &quot\;given\, when\, then&quot\; perspective. The re
 sult: cleaner\, clearer tests that both validate your requirements and d
 ocument your system behavior.</p>\n<p>Testing behaviors has never been s
 o easy\, and so real! If you care about quality of your software you def
 initely shouldn&#39\;t miss this talk!</p>\n

DESCRIPTION:\n					<p>The myth of Java EE as a cumbersome platform is eas
 ily dispelled in this session\, which aims to create a working applicati
 on\, from a blank repository to a live cloud deployment\, in real time. 
 It:</p>\n<p>• Covers tools that bootstrap project creation\, freeing y
 ou from mucking around with Maven POM boilerplate<br />\n* Generates a d
 omain model and reverse-engineers JPA entities from it<br />\n* Automati
 cally creates the scaffolding for tests that run in a real Java EE conta
 iner\, launched from the IDE<br />\n* Pushes it all to production on a p
 ublic site</p>\n<p>Using a variety of projects from the JBoss Community 
 adhering to and building upon open standards\, this presentation can cre
 ate real enterprise apps in the time it takes other sessions to click th
 rough some slides. Let’s get building!</p>\n

DESCRIPTION:\n					<p>Arquillian is a revolutionary testing platform for 
 Java and the JVM that enables developers to easily create and execute in
 tegration and functional tests for Java middleware\, from Java EE and be
 yond. One of Arquillian’s strong points is its extensibility. Arquilli
 an was built with the ability to change its default behavior via its pow
 erful extension model as well as to grow past its original programming t
 o take on the challenges of tomorrow. This presentation guides you throu
 gh the Arquillian extensions by demonstrating how specific extensions so
 lve common problematic testing scenarios faced by enterprise developers.
  You will get a overview of what is available and possible today as well
  as what is brewing in the community.</p>\n

DESCRIPTION:\n					<p>This highly technical session examines solutions fo
 r easing the testing of some of the more complex use cases within Java E
 E. Each example is backed by a runnable test (publicly available to part
 icipants)\, and the presentation covers automated continuous development
  of:</p>\n<p>• The Web user interface (via Selenium)<br />\n• Persis
 tent data and JPA<br />\n• Transactional boundaries<br />\n• Cloud-b
 ased deployments<br />\n• RESTful endpoints<br />\n• More</p>\n<p>It
  showcases various techniques outlined in the book Continuous Enterprise
  Development in Java\, forthcoming from O’Reilly Media\, and is delive
 red by the authors. Expect a lot of proof through open source demos. You
 &#39\;ll see the presenters exercise the features of any compliant Java 
 EE 6 runtime\, using the Arquillian platform.</p>\n

DESCRIPTION:\n					<p>Using a Web application is easy. Testing it should 
 be easy as well. Arquillian\, a revolutionary Java enterprise testing pl
 atform—together with its extensions Arquillian Drone and Arquillian An
 droid—enables that. In this tutorial\, you will learn how to integrate
  existing testing frameworks such as JUnit with the Web testing tool Sel
 enium. It also leverages the Maven infrastructure of a project. Whatever
  technology you are using to create Web pages\, wherever the application
  is deployed\, and whatever browser—including mobile ones—you are us
 ing\, configuring a test environment is a matter of minutes. Do not spen
 d time with configuration\; skip right to writing Web tests.</p>\n

DESCRIPTION:\n					<p>In modern development environments\, it’s a must 
 to include testing of Web applications as a standard part of the develop
 ment lifecycle. Such tests can also be used as acceptance criteria in en
 terprise projects. Although full automation is possible\, it is consider
 ed to be very expensive. As a result\, in projects where testing is incl
 uded as part of the project plan\, it is also often the first requiremen
 t cut when the project schedule begins to slip. Learn more in this sessi
 on.</p>\n
