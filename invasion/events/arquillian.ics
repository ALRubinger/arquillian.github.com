DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>Apache TomEE is the Java EE 6 Web Profile certified 
 version of Apache Tomcat and combines the simplicity of Tomcat with the 
 power of Java EE. The first half of this session introduces TomEE and sh
 ows how Tomcat applications leveraging Java EE technologies can become s
 impler and lighter with a Java EE 6 certified solution built right on To
 mcat. The second half focuses on those already familiar with TomEE and g
 oes into detail on latest advancements\, testing techniques including Ar
 quillian\, clustering features and production considerations. If you&#39
 \;re a Tomcat lover or a TomEE enthusiast\, this is the session you don&
 #39\;t want to miss!</p>\n

DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>A common complaint you hear a lot about Java develop
 ment is that it is quite a burden to get started. For a newbie\, it take
 s a lot of knowledge and effort to even put the simplest JSF application
  to work. A second element that bothers a lot of people is that it is ve
 ry difficult to verify that your enterprise components actually do what 
 they are supposed to do. Even for seasoned enterprise developers integra
 tion testing can be a huge challenge<br />\nLuckily two recent additions
  to the JBoss toolset come to the rescue. Arquillian is a container-orie
 nted testing framework built on TestNG and JUnit. It takes down the barr
 ier of bootstrapping the necessary infrastructure when trying to perform
  integration tests. It lets you test your components in their real targe
 t runtime environment using real enterprise services. Secondly\, JBoss F
 orge is an incremental enhancement tool that lets you take an existing J
 ava project and safely add in new functionality. Whether you want to set
  up JSF\, use persistence or enable integration testing with Arquillian\
 , it all becomes a real breeze.<br />\nAttend this session to learn how 
 to take advantage of both these tools. You will see how they can be used
  to rapidly create\, test and deploy enterprise Java applications. In ad
 dition\, I will show how you can extend the functionality of JBoss Forge
  by creating plugins.</p>\n
