DESCRIPTION:\n					<p>Unit tests are programmer&#39\;s best friend\, but 
 relying on them exclusively gives an illusion of overall system integrit
 y. At some level\, we need to verify how our components integrate and en
 sure unexpected behavior does not creep in when we shift the application
  into the target runtime. It all amounts to whether your application is 
 providing the end user what he or she is really needs (tire swing) inste
 ad of what anyone thinks they need. How can we save our users from frust
 ration\, keep the fail whale at bay and communicate with stakeholders th
 at the requirements are being met?</p>\n<p>We&#39\;ll show you how the A
 rquillian testing platform can give you these guarantees by driving agil
 e development. We&#39\;ll explore the concepts of BDD and ATDD together 
 using a powerful trio of testing frameworks: Arquillian\, WebDriver and 
 Thucydides. Rather than just test cases\, you&#39\;ll build higher-level
 \, end-to-end functional behavior using reusable web test components and
  following a clear &quot\;given\, when\, then&quot\; perspective. The re
 sult: cleaner\, clearer tests that both validate your requirements and d
 ocument your system behavior.</p>\n<p>Testing behaviors has never been s
 o easy\, and so real! If you care about quality of your software you def
 initely shouldn&#39\;t miss this talk!</p>\n
