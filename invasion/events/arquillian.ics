DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>Apache TomEE is the Java EE 6 Web Profile certified 
 version of Apache Tomcat and combines the simplicity of Tomcat with the 
 power of Java EE. The first half of this session introduces TomEE and sh
 ows how Tomcat applications leveraging Java EE technologies can become s
 impler and lighter with a Java EE 6 certified solution built right on To
 mcat.</p>\n<p>The second half focuses on those already familiar with Tom
 EE and goes into detail on latest advancements\, testing techniques incl
 uding Arquillian\, clustering features and production considerations. If
  you&#39\;re a Tomcat lover or a TomEE enthusiast\, this is the session 
 you don&#39\;t want to miss!</p>\n

DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>Arquillian is an innovative and highly extensible te
 sting platform for the JVM that enables developers to easily create auto
 mated integration\, functional and acceptance tests for Java middleware\
 , from Java EE and beyond.</p>\n<p>In this presentation\, we&#39\;ll foc
 us on the &quot\;highly extensible&quot\; part\, one of Arquillian&#39\;
 s proven strengths. Arquillian was designed with the ability to change i
 ts default behavior via its powerful extension model. These extensions a
 re portals through which Arquillian can travel to take on challenges in 
 new domains or those yet to be realized.</p>\n<p>This presentation takes
  you on a tour through the universe of Arquillian extensions by demonstr
 ating how specific extensions solve common problematic testing scenarios
  faced by enterprise developers. You will get a overview of what extensi
 ons and extension points are available today and what ideas are starting
  to take shape in the community.</p>\n
