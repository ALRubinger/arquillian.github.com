SUMMARY:Continuous Enterprise Development in Java
DESCRIPTION:\n					<p>Are you confident enough to push your application to 
 production right now? Will it deploy? Integrate all the components? Keep th
 e fail whale at bay? Confidence comes from tests. Real tests.</p>\n<p>Disco
 ver how to use Arquillian to develop tests that execute inside a container\
 , use BDD and ATDD for integration and acceptance tests that your stakehold
 ers can grok and gain the confidence you need to continue developing\, know
 ing your application will remain standing when faced with the real world.</

SUMMARY:The Arquillian Universe - A tour around the astrophysics lab
DESCRIPTION:\n					<p>Arquillian is a revolutionary testing platform for Ja
 va and the JVM<br />\nthat enables developers to easily create and execute 
 integration and<br />\nfunctional tests for Java middleware\, from Java EE 
 and beyond.</p>\n<p>One of Arquillian&#39\;s strong points is its extensibi
 lity. Arquillian was<br />\nbuilt with the ability to change its default be
 havior via its powerful<br />\nextension model\, as well as to grow outside
  of its original<br />\nprogramming to take on the challenges of tomorrow.<
 /p>\n<p>The speakers will guide you trough the Arquillian Extensions by<br 
 />\ndemonstrating how specific extensions solve common\, problematic<br />\
 ntesting scenarios faced by enterprise developers. You will get a<br />\nov
 erview of what is available and possible today\, as well as what is<br />\n
 brewing in the community.</p>\n

SUMMARY:Rapid Application Development with JBoss Forge
DESCRIPTION:\n					<p>A common complaint you hear a lot about Java developm
 ent is that it is quite a burden to get started. For a newbie\, it takes a 
 lot of knowledge and effort to even put the simplest JSF application to wor
 k. <br />\nJBoss Forge is an incremental enhancement tool that lets you tak
 e an existing Java project and safely work in new functionality. Whether yo
 u want to set up JSF\, use persistence or enable integration testing with A
 rquillian\, it all becomes a real breeze.<br />\nIn this session you will l
 earn how to take advantage this powerful new technology. You will see how i
 t can be used to rapidly create\, test and deploy enterprise Java applicati
 ons. Forge truly will turn out to be one of the missing links you have been
  looking for in Java development.</p>\n

SUMMARY:Acceptance Test Driven Development with Arquillian
DESCRIPTION:\n				\n					<p>It’s great to have a solid base of unit and i
 ntegration tests\; this gives us confidence about overall system integrity.
  But at the end of the day it all amounts to whether our end users are happ
 y using our application. So how can we keep the fail whale at bay and commu
 nicate with the stakeholders that the requirements are being met?</p>\n\n<p
 >During this talk we will see that the Arquillian ecosystem is way more tha
 n just integration testing. We will dive into the concept of Acceptance Tes
 t Driven Development (ATDD) and demonstrate how to build higher-level\, end
 -to-end functional tests\; we willl be emulating user interactions using th
 e Arquillian Drone extension together with the open source browser automati
 on tool WebDriver. Reusable web testing components called Page Objects will
  make our tests cleaner and easier to maintain. Eventually we will sugar co
 at them with a Groovy DSL for Behaviour Driven Development to achieve testi
 ng nirvana.</p>\n\n<p>If you care about quality of your software you defini
 tely shouldn&#39\;t miss this talk! Expect to see lots of live demos!</p>\n
