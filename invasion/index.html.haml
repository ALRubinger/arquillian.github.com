   p(well). Arquillian is a revolutionary testing platform for Java and the JVM that enables developers to easily create and execute integration and functional tests for Java middleware, from Java EE and beyond.

   Picking up where unit tests leave off, Arquillian handles all the plumbing of container management, archive deployment and framework initialization so you can focus on the task at hand, writing your tests. _Real tests_.

   In short...

   h2. Arquillian makes integration testing a breeze!

   Arquillian minimizes the burden on you--the developer--by covering all aspects of test execution, including:

   * Managing the lifecycle of the container (start/stop),
   * Bundling the test class with dependent classes and resources into a deployable archive,
   * Enhancing the test class (e.g., resolving @@Inject@, @@EJB@ and @@Resource@ injections),
   * Deploying the archive to test (deploy/undeploy) and
   * Capturing results and failures.

   To avoid introducing unnecessary complexity into the developer's build environment, Arquillian integrates seamlessly with familiar testing frameworks (e.g., JUnit 4, TestNG 5), allowing tests to be launched using existing IDE, Ant and Maven test plugins -- without any add-ons.
