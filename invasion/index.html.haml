title: Arquillian Invasion!

   The mission of the Arquillian project is to provide a simple test harness that abstracts away all container lifecycle and deployment from the test logic so developers can easily produce a broad range of integration tests for their enterprise Java applications.

   h2{color: #8c3d33}. Arquillian makes integration testing a breeze!

   Arquillian minimizes the burden on the developer when writing integration tests by handling all aspects of test execution, including:

   * managing the lifecycle of the container (start/stop),
   * bundling the test class with dependent classes and resources into a deployable archive,
   * enhancing the test class (e.g., resolving @@Inject@, @@EJB@ and @@Resource@ injections),
   * deploying the archive to test (deploy/undeploy) and
   * capturing results and failures.

   To avoid introducing unnecessary complexity into the developer's build environment, Arquillian integrates transparently with familiar testing frameworks (e.g., JUnit 4, TestNG 5), allowing tests to be launched using existing IDE, Ant and Maven test plugins without any add-ons.
